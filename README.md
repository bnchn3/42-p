# 42-p
This repository holds all the work I've completed at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/).

## Projects
The [Projects](Projects) folder contains all the major projects completed in the main curriculum. Each project took about 70 hours to complete and were all completed in C unless explicitly stated.

## Piscines
Piscines (French for swimming pool) are 42's concentrated bootcamps that throw students "into the deep end" of a specific computer language. Every weekday a new set of exercises are given, and students are expected to complete as many as they can before the next day's exercises. On the weekends, students must complete a group project called a "rush".

### C
This is the introductory piscine all prospective students must pass in order to officially enroll at 42. Since this piscine is also meant for students who have never coded before, it teaches basic coding principles along with Unix and C over the course of a month.

### PHP
This piscine is only available to cadets Level 5 and higher and is meant to introduce students to Object Oriented Programming and web design and development. This piscine taught HTML/CSS, SQL, and JavaScript along with PHP over the course of two weeks.
