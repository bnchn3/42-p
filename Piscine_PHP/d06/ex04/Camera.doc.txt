<- Camera ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Camera class handles the positioning and orientation of a camera in
3D space.

An instance can be constructed from an array of the following values:
'origin'		a Vertex representing the camera's position in the world
'orientation'	a rotation Matrix representing the camera's orientation in the world
'width'			width in pixel of desired image (not compatible with 'ratio')
'height'		height in pixel of desired image (not compatible with 'ratio')
'ratio'			image ratio (not compatible with 'width and 'height')
'fov'			field of view in degrees
'near'			near clipping plane
'far'			far clipping plane

Provided methods:
Vertex watchVertex( Vertex $worldVertex ) : transforms a 3D vertex into 2D coordinates
